Gameplay

  Birds - 
Each bird has two racing stats (speed & stamina), an energy level, name, colour, and gender

  Racing - 
If a birds' speed and stamina are greater than its' rival, it will place higher than that rival in the race. If the stat values are equal, the birds' placement is randomized

  Feeding - 
Preforming actions (breeding, racing, etc.) will deplete your birds' energy level, it can be refilled by spending a few coins to feed it.

  Breeding - 
A baby brids genetics are loosely based off of its' parents' genes, with some genetic luck, they can be born faster or more robust than their parents. All baby birds are born hungry and should be fed straight away.

  Selling - 
A birds value in coins is equal to the sum of their speed and stamina stats

Planned Updates (mainly focused on balancing the game & increasing difficulty)

- Add gender symbol
- Add more bird colourations
- Disallow the sale of all birds of a specific sex so that the game won't be broken
- Vet fee for breeding
- Add training option, costs both hunger and coins to increase a chosen stat (breeding will be based on genetic stats as they were at the birds' hatching)
- Add racing entry fee (increases based on tier - high tier races have more prize coins to be won)
- Add more rivals with randomized stats
- Add racing tiers for more advanced birds
- Track birds' races won, a bird will be able to enter high tier races after winning many beginner races
- Accessories (don't interfere with a races' results)
- Tack (effects a birds' preformance)
